# CLAUDE.md — Stretch Daily

This file is the handoff document between Claude Code sessions. Update the
**Current state** section at the end of every session.

---

## 1. Project overview

Stretch Daily is a native Android app (Kotlin / Jetpack Compose) that gives
the user a personalized 10–15 minute mobility + tendon-resilience routine
each day. The "Longevity Engine" weights exercise selection toward the body
areas where the user's monthly benchmarks indicate the most stiffness.

- **Package**: `com.stretchdaily.app`
- **Tech**: Kotlin 2.0, Jetpack Compose (BOM 2024.10), Room 2.6, Hilt 2.52,
  KSP, Compose Navigation, DataStore, kotlinx.serialization, Coil
- **Min SDK**: 30 — **Target/Compile SDK**: 35
- **Java target**: 17 (using JDK 21 bundled with Android Studio)

---

## 2. Current state

**Last updated**: 2026-04-07 (end of Phase 1 session)
**Active branch**: `chore/repo-init` (per plan, this single branch covers the
whole Phase 1 scaffold; PR target is `development`)

**Just completed**: Phase 1 — Project Scaffold + Database
- Gradle wrapper + version catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`)
- App shell: `AndroidManifest.xml`, `StretchDailyApp` (`@HiltAndroidApp`),
  `MainActivity` (`@AndroidEntryPoint`) with placeholder Compose screen
- Dark theme with orange accents (`ui/theme/`)
- All Room entities: `Exercise`, `Benchmark`, `BenchmarkLog`, `SessionRecord`,
  `SessionExercise` + enums `Category`, `FlexibilityTier`, `BenchmarkInputType`
- DAOs: `ExerciseDao`, `BenchmarkDao`, `BenchmarkLogDao`, `SessionDao`
- `Converters` (kotlinx.serialization for List/Map, name-based for enums)
- `StretchDailyDatabase` with `RoomDatabase.Callback.onCreate` seeding
- `DatabaseSeeder` with all 46 exercises and 10 benchmarks
- Hilt `DatabaseModule` providing the database, all DAOs, and an
  `@ApplicationScope CoroutineScope`

**Next up**: Phase 2 — Longevity Engine (`feature/longevity-engine`)
1. `CategoryWeightCalculator` — latest BenchmarkLog → `Map<Category, Double>`
2. `SelectionShield` — exercises stale for >14 days
3. `SessionBuilder` — weighted random selection within 600–900s budget
4. `LongevityEngine` — public `generateSession()` API
5. Unit tests (this is the core algorithm — test thoroughly)

**Known issues**:
- **Gradle CLI build blocked on this Windows machine — no JDK-side fix
  exists.** Any `./gradlew` invocation that needs a Selector (i.e. anything
  that starts a daemon, which is every real task) fails with
  `java.io.IOException: Unable to establish loopback connection` →
  `SocketException: Invalid argument: connect` inside
  `UnixDomainSockets.connect0`.
  - **Root cause**: `sun.nio.ch.PipeImpl` (used by *every* Windows Selector
    implementation — both `WEPollSelectorImpl` **and** the legacy
    `WindowsSelectorImpl`) constructs its wakeup pipe by calling
    `createListener(preferUnixDomain = true)` and then opening a client
    `SocketChannel` against it. `createListener()` will fall back from UDS
    to TCP on listener bind failure, but there is **no fallback** if the
    client `connect()` fails — so `UnixDomainSockets.connect0` throws
    `SocketException: Invalid argument: connect` and pipe init dies. On
    Ramon's Windows 11 24H2 Enterprise machine the UDS *listener bind*
    succeeds but the *client connect* fails at the kernel level — almost
    certainly corporate security software (NinjaOne / Citrix) intercepting
    AF_UNIX sockets. Reproducible with a 3-line `Selector.open()` program.
  - **Verified in JDK 17, JDK 21, and JDK 25 source** (extracted from each
    JDK's `lib/src.zip`). The UDS code path is present in all three — the
    earlier theory that "JDK 17 uses TCP loopback only" was wrong: both
    `WEPollSelectorImpl` (JDK 17+ default) and `WindowsSelectorImpl` (the
    legacy provider still shipped in JDK 17+) call `new PipeImpl(sp, /*
    AF_UNIX */ true, ...)`. There is no JDK 17/21/25 that avoids UDS in
    `PipeImpl`.
  - **Tested and failed (2026-04-07)**: JBR 21 (Android Studio bundled),
    Microsoft OpenJDK 17.0.18+8 LTS, Microsoft OpenJDK 25.0.2+10 LTS, with
    `--no-daemon`, removing `org.gradle.jvmargs`, `GRADLE_OPTS`,
    `-Djava.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider=sun.nio.ch.WindowsSelectorProvider`
    (forces the legacy provider — stack moves to `WindowsSelectorImpl` but
    still hits UDS), `-Dsun.nio.ch.defaultProvider=...`,
    `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true`, custom
    `java.io.tmpdir`, run from bash and `cmd.exe`, Bash tool sandbox
    disabled. All fail identically at `UnixDomainSockets.connect0`. Gradle
    `--version` is the only task that "works" because the launcher JVM
    never opens a Selector.
  - **Workaround that works**: build from Android Studio's UI
    (Build → Make Project). Its internal Gradle Tooling API integration
    uses a different IPC path that bypasses the failing socket.
  - **True fixes** (none attempted yet, not required for development):
    1. Ask IT to whitelist / reconfigure the UDS-intercepting security
       software.
    2. Run Gradle inside WSL2 where UDS goes through Linux, not the
       Windows security filter driver.
    3. Patch / shim `sun.nio.ch.PipeImpl` to force TCP — invasive,
       not recommended.
  - **Operational rule for Claude sessions**: do NOT spend turn budget
    retrying gradle CLI workarounds. Either ask Ramon to build from Android
    Studio and report back, or restrict verification to manual code review
    and tell Ramon that compilation is unverified.
- Phase 1 code has been compiled successfully via **Android Studio
  (Build → Make Project)** on 2026-04-07. Gradle CLI verification is still
  blocked by the issue above; Android Studio remains the verification path
  going forward.

## 3. Architecture summary

- **MVVM**: ViewModel + StateFlow (no LiveData). UI is 100% Compose.
- **DI**: Hilt. Single `SingletonComponent` module (`DatabaseModule`) for now;
  more modules will be added per feature phase.
- **Database**: Room with KSP. Seeded once at file creation via
  `RoomDatabase.Callback.onCreate` running on `Dispatchers.IO` inside the
  injected `@ApplicationScope` coroutine scope.
- **Engine**: Will live in `core/engine/` as pure Kotlin (no Android
  dependencies) so it can be unit-tested with plain JVM tests.
- **Navigation**: Will use Compose Navigation with type-safe routes (Phase 3+).

---

## 4. Key conventions

- **Branch model**: `main` (protected) ← PRs ← `development` ← feature
  branches. One PR per phase. Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`,
  `docs:`). Push every commit immediately. See
  `.claude/skills/git-flow/SKILL.md`.
- **Theme**: Fixed dark theme. Background `#0D0D0D`, surface `#1A1A1A`,
  primary/accent `#FF8C00`. No dynamic colors.
- **No backwards compatibility cruft**: Don't keep dead enum values, unused
  re-exports, or `// removed` comments. Just delete.
- **No speculative abstractions**: Inline a few similar lines instead of
  building an early helper. Add structure when the third use case shows up.
- **Comments**: Only where the logic isn't self-evident. Don't narrate code.

## 6. Data notes

- **46 exercises** across 7 categories. IDs are zero-padded per category
  (`N01..N06`, `S01..S07`, `W01..W06`, `SP01..SP07`, `H01..H07`, `K01..K07`,
  `A01..A06`).
- **10 benchmarks**: 9 numeric (`Cervical Rotation`, `Apley Scratch Test`,
  `Seated Thoracic Rotation`, `Sit and Reach`, `Thomas Test`,
  `Butterfly Stretch`, `Knee-to-Wall`, `Wrist Extension`, `Wrist Flexion`)
  and 1 categorical (`ATG Split Squat`).
- **`Apley Scratch Test`**: original spreadsheet labels unit "Score" but the
  ranges are cm gaps. We treat it as numeric in cm.
- **`Sit and Reach`**: lower (negative) values mean *more* flexible. The Phase
  4 TierResolver must handle direction-reversed ranges.
- **`totalTime`** in the spreadsheet already accounts for both sides of
  unilateral exercises — don't double it.
- **Cue count**: variable (1–4 per exercise), not always 3 as the blueprint
  suggested. Stored faithfully as a `List<String>`.
- **Exercise time cap**: the engine (Phase 2) caps any single exercise at
  120s of session budget — defensive even though no current exercise blows
  past that.

## 7. Build commands

The user has not modified Windows env vars. Always invoke gradle with the
`JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME` prefixes inline (Bash/MINGW path syntax):

```bash
JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr" \
ANDROID_HOME="/c/Users/RamonvanSchalm/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk" \
./gradlew <task>
```

Common tasks:

```bash
# Compile + assemble debug APK (use this to verify Room/Hilt code-gen)
JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr" ANDROID_HOME="/c/Users/RamonvanSchalm/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk" ./gradlew assembleDebug

# Run JVM unit tests (engine, utils)
JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr" ANDROID_HOME="/c/Users/RamonvanSchalm/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk" ./gradlew test

# Clean
JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr" ANDROID_HOME="/c/Users/RamonvanSchalm/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk" ./gradlew clean

# Instrumented tests (require connected device/emulator — user runs these)
JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr" ANDROID_HOME="/c/Users/RamonvanSchalm/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk" ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

We can't run an emulator from inside Claude Code, so UI verification is
delegated to the user. Compilation + unit tests are the verification gate
during a session.
